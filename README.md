# Design Docs for the Libft

Makefile will need a rework eventually.


In total there are: 90 Functions.

The Libft is divided into two groups of functions, those that are extremely useful
and found commonly throughout my projects, and those that are far less common.

This Design Doc mimics the tree structure of the libft file, each function appears
here where it would in the actual file. Folowing the name of each function is a
short description of what it does and then a more technical description of how it
accomplishes that.

Rework split ?
Consider adding a list of just the names of all the functions, one for both groups

Any left in Cub3D ?


## Essencial Functions
39

### Complex Functions
4
##### StrJoin ✅
Joins 2 strings together into a larger string.
Takes 2 strings s1 and s2. Allocates memory for a new string, fills it,
returns a string or null if error.

##### FStrJoin ✅
Free Join, joins 2 strings together into a larger string, but makes sure
to free them both, error or not, can handle empty strings.
Takes 2 pointers to strings s1 and s2. Allocates memory for a new string,
uses fstrlen to count length of strings, fills the new string and frees
the old ones, returns a string or null if error.

##### Split ✅
Divides a string into 'words' spliting then using a set of char.
Takes 2 strings s and set. The number of words s can be divided into
according to set is counted and a pointer to strings is allocated with
that many slots. Then the length of each word is counted and allocated
to the next available slot in the table of strings, the slot is then
filled. Returns a table of strings or null if error.

##### GNL
Reads and returns one line of a file at a time.
Takes 2 pointers to strings l and s, and 2 ints b size and fd.
Returns 1 on line successfully returned, -1 if error and 0 if nothing
left to be read. (I think... Should test)



### Linked List Functions
13

#### T List Functions
T List Structure has a void pointer called content and a pointer to
the next link
##### LstNew
Creates a new T List containing argument passed.
Takes a void pointer to content, allocates a T List, inits it's
variables and returns the T List.

##### LstAdd Front
Adds a new T List to the begining of a T List linked list.
Takes a pointer to the pointer to the first elem of the T List linked
list, and the new T List elem, prepends the elem. Returns void.

##### LstAdd Back
Adds a new T List to the end of a T List linked list.
Takes a pointer to the pointer to the first elem of the T List linked
list, and the new T List elem, appends the elem. Returns void.

##### LstDelOne
Applies a Delete function to a single element of a T List linked list.
Takes a pointer to the element to be deleted, and a pointer to the del
function. Applies the del function, frees the pointer to the elem.
Returns void.

##### LstClear
Deletes an entire T List linked list.
Takes a pointer to the linked list, and a pointer to the del function.
Applies the del function to every element of the list and frees them,
finally frees the pointer to the linked list. Returns void.

##### LstIter

this element is returned.

##### LstMap
Iterates through a T List linked list applying a function to the conents
and creating a new parallel linked list with the results.
Takes a pointer to the origional T List linked list, a pointer to the
function to be applied, and a pointer to a del function. For each elem of
the origional list a new corresponding elem is allocated and assigned the
results of the passed function, should that function fail, the del func
is applied instead. This function is recursive, the return is the new
T List elem that has been created in a particular iteration, until the
list is exhausted at which point it returns NULL.

##### LstSize

Takes a pointer to the first elem of a T List linked list, iterates

through while applying the Print Elem (as seen above) function.
Returns void.

##### LstGen
Creates a T List linked list out of a string and seperator character.
Easily used in conjunction with argv and argc, great for testing.
Takes a string and a char. Creates a table of strings from these
arguments using the Split function, then turns these strings into
T List elems with LstNew and links them together with LstAdd Front.
Returns a pointer to the new T List linked list's first element.

##### LstRev
Reverses the order of the elems of a T List linked list.
Takes a pointer to a T List linked list, iterates through the list
swaping elems around in such a way that none are lost. Returns void.


### Medium Functions
12

##### Memalloc ✅
Actually very useful. Quite similar to malloc only after allocating a given amount
of memory it fills it with \0s.

memory space.

##### StrDup
Makes a copy of a string, handles the allocation.
Takes a string s1. Counts its size, allocates that much memory and fills it with
s1. Returns the new string or null if failure.

Makes a copy of a string, handles the allocation.

str, allocates that much memory and fills it with str. Returns the new string or
null if failure or str does not exist.

##### NStrDup
Makes a copy of a string, handles the allocation.
Takes a pointer to a string cp, and a string og. Very similar to fstrdup but sends
an int back to confirm success or failure, used in those rare occations when the
string you want to copy could be null but that would not be a failure. Allocates
the memory for cp and fills it from og. Returns 1 if og is null, 0 if cp is null
or malloc failure, and 1 if normal success.

##### Free StrTab ✅
Frees a table of strings, the likes you might end up with from using split.

table. Returns 0 if error or 1 if success.

it with this, returns the string or null if error.

##### Atoi ✅
Turns an string into an int.
Takes a string, ignores prefix whitespaces, understands + or - sign,
iterates through the digits adding their value to an int which is
multiplied by a factor of ten each time. Returns an int. Has the same
querks as the original atoi.

##### Latoi ✅
Turns a string into a long and counts the number of char necessary to
display that int.
Takes a string and a pointer to a long. The long will hold the final
result of the string to long translation. The return is an int which
represents the length of the number and sign (if relevant). Other
than these particularities it's algorythm is identical to that of the
regular atoi.

##### Itoa ✅
Turns an int into a string, the opposit of atoi.
Takes an int. The length necessary to hold the int is calculated
(including sign), a string of that size is allocated and then filled
back to front, cuting off the last digit of the int on each iteration.
Returns the string containing the number.

##### PosItoa ✅
Nearly identical to Itoa, except it only handle positive numbers in
order to handle the largest possible number, an unsigned long long.
Takes an unsigned long long, returns a string. The algorythm is nearly
identical to that of Itoa.

##### SubStr ✅
Copies the contents of a string from a given start point for a given
length.
Takes a string s, an unsigned int start and a size t len. A string of
len + 1 is allocated, it is filled with the contents of s starting from
start and for len char or until s is exhausted. Returns the new string
or null if error.

itself.

return ret regardless of if str exists.

##### StrLen
Counts the length of a string.
Takes a string s. Iterates through it keeping count, returns a size t
